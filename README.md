# music-player
A very basic Music Player coded in Java with backend in Python to handle API requests. Streams from YouTube.
Includes implementation of playlists and a working queue. Also displays album covers for the current playing song.
The backend utilises yt-dlp and ytmusicapi for playing and searching songs respectively. For now, a python file containing the code in form of a flask app running locally is required for the player to function.

(coded for MA-104, sem-2)
